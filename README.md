# LeetCode

Greetings! You have found my personal collection of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions. Check out my [progress](https://leetcode.com/szelesandor/), read along and enjoy your stay!

## Motivation

I've created this project to test my problem-solving skills. I wanted to see if I could solve all the free Study Plan challenges LeetCode has to offer during their limited time frame. And after I did, it just wasn't enough! So now I'm solving various problems for experience and fun. My main tool for this is Python 3, because it's a high-level, solution-centric language that is fast to write and easy to read.

## Philosophy

I just love beautiful things. And code, as most good things in life, can also be beautiful. According to my definition, beautiful code not only solves a problem, but also does it in the most elegant way. Therefore, I always strive to write modular, self-documenting clean code that is both simple to understand and easy to reason about. The following points of [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) are especially dear to my heart:

> - Beautiful is better than ugly.
>
> - Explicit is better than implicit.
> 
> - Simple is better than complex.
> 
> - Complex is better than complicated.
> 
> - Readability counts.
> 
> - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> 
> - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

## Project structure

My solutions lay inside the `Problems` folder. There you can find `Study Plans` that contains some descriptively named subfolders. Files inside `Algorithm`, `Data Structure` and `Dynamic Programming` are numbered chronologically, in the order I first encountered them. Other folders inside `Problems` have solutions organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), and the files inside these follow the same chronological numbering convention seen before. The names of the files reflect the names of the problems, and on the first line I always provide a link to the original problem description for reference.

## Code reuse

If you want to use my code for your own project, you're welcome to do so as long as you respect the LICENSE found in the root directory. But please don't submit my solutions on LeetCode as yours! That would be cheating. I'm also asking you to check the solutions only after you have solved the referenced problems yourself. Or at least have spent some quantifiable time attempting so. The best way to improve your skills is learning by doing, after all...
